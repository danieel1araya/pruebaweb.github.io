          <p>
            Lionel Messi is an Argentinian soccer player who has played for FC
            Barcelona, Paris Saint-Germain, and currently, the MLS club Inter
            Miami CF as well as the Argentina national team. As a teenager,
            Messi moved from Argentina to Spain after FC Barcelona agreed to pay
            for medical treatments related to his growth hormone disorder. At
            the club, he earned renown as one of the greatest players in
            history, helping FC Barcelona win more than two dozen league titles
            and tournaments. In 2012, he set a record for most goals in a
            calendar year.
